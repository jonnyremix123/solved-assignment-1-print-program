Use the Visual C++ IDE to complete the following programming tasks:

<ul>

 <li>Write one (1) program that prints out a user’s astrological sign.</li>

 <li>The program should ask a user to enter his / her birth month and birth day (the year is not important).</li>

 <li>Use a switch statement to examine the months and the correct if statement so that the program may determine the birth date and its relation to astrology.</li>

 <li>Use the chart below as a guide:</li>

</ul>
